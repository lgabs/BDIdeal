# BDIdeal app and the Best Bidding Price for Public Budgets
Graduation Thesis defended by me in the Aeronautical Institute of Technology (Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica - ITA).

During the typical public bidding budget, the bid price of a particular work is composed
not only by the direct costs, i.e, those that occur specifically on account of the execution of
the work, but also by indirect costs, called Benefits and Indirect Costs (BDI), or markup,
term that in English is divided into indirect costs (overhead) and profit. By including
some subjective items, whose calculation is only possible through indirect estimates and
approximations, the BDI calculation does not follow a single standard and is peculiar to
each work, making it difficult to create references for the term, therefore, preventing a
precise analysis of its impact on bid price.
Hence, the present work proposes a rigorous methodology for the calculation of BDI, based
on minimizing the risk of financial losses for the contractor (which is reflected on losses for
the Public Administration) and in the consideration of several relevant attibutes of typical
constructions. The proposed method serves as a decision parameter along with the current
method recommended by the Brazilian Federal Court of Accounts (TCU). To make the
method more pratical, a application in Python was developed, allowing a direct usage of
the methodology by the the Administration in public budgets.
